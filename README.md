# Plagiarism Checker Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The Plagiarism Checker Project is designed to detect similarity between two text documents.
It compares words from the given inputs and calculates a similarity percentage to identify copied content.

This project is organized using GitHub branches to clearly separate frontend, backend, documentation, and testing.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect plagiarism between text documents
- Calculate similarity percentage
- Learn backend logic using Python
- Understand GitHub branching and version control
- Maintain clean project structure

## 🧩 Branch-wise Description (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Main Branch
- Final and stable version of the project
- Contains the main README file
- All tested features are merged here

---

### 2️⃣ Frontend Branch
- Handles user interface concepts
- Describes how users will input text
- Displays plagiarism results

Example:
- Text input fields
- Result display section

---

### 3️⃣ Backend Branch
- Core logic of the project
- Written in Python
- Compares two texts and finds similarity

Backend Process:
1. Take text input
2. Split text into words
3. Find common words
4. Calculate similarity percentage

---

### 4️⃣ Documentation Branch
- Contains complete project explanation
- Used for reports and submissions
- Explains objectives, tools, and outcomes

---

### 5️⃣ Testing Branch
- Contains test cases
- Validates plagiarism logic

Example test cases:
- Same text → 100% similarity
- Different text → 0% similarity
- Partial match → Partial percentage
